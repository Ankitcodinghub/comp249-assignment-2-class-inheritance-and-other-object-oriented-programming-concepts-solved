The purpose of this assignment is to practice class inheritance, and other Object Oriented Programming concepts such as constructors, access rights, method overriding, etc. The assignment would also allow you to practice the notion of package creation. This assignment contains two parts. You need to complete part I to be able to do part II.

You have been hired by the metropolitan events planning office to write a software application that helps the office manage the year around events.

Part I

Various events can be described as follows:

 A Event class with the following: the year (XXXX: int type), month (YY:int type), and the number of cities where it will be held (int type).

 A Festival is an Event that in addition has the following: a name (String type- such as Arts, Beer, Comedy, Film, Fire, Folk…etc), ticket price (double type), and duration:# of_days (int type).

 A Culturalfiesta is a Festival that in addition has the following: the number of spoken languages (int type), which indicates the maximum languages spoken in this kind of festival.

 A Musicfiesta is a Festival that in addition it has the following: number of bands (int type).

 A SportCompetition is an Event that in addition has the following: number of activitie (int type) and season name (enumeration type that can be: summer, fall, winter, spring)

 A fair is an Event that in addition has the following: The number of exibitors (int type), and type (enumerator type that can be : career, science, trade, travel)

Part I:

1. Draw a UML representation for the above mentioned classes hierarchy. Your representation must also be accurate in terms of UML representation of the different entities and the relation between them. You must use a software to draw your UML diagrams (no hand-writing/drawing is allowed).

2. Write the implementation of the above mentioned classes using inheritance and according to the specifications and requirements given below:

 You must have 4 different Java packages for the classes. The first package will include the Event class. The second package will include the Festival, Culturalfiesta, and Musicfiesta classes. The third package will include the SportCompetition class and the last package will include the Fair class.

Comp249/Winter 2018 – Assignment 2 Page 2 of 4

 For each of the classes, you must have at least three constructors, a default constructor, a parametrized constructor (which will accept enough parameters to initialize ALL the attributes of the created object from this class) and a copy constructor. For instance the parametrized constructor of the Culturalfiesta class must accept 7 parameters to initialize the year, month, #number_ of_cities, name, ticket price, duration, and #of languages.

 An object creation using the default constructor must trigger the default constructor of its ancestor classes, while creation using parametrized constructors must trigger the parametrized constructors of the ancestors.

 For each of the classes, you must include at least the following methods: accessors, mutators, toString() and equals() methods (notice that you are always overriding the last two methods).

 The toString() method must display clear description and information of the object (i.e “This arts Culturalfiesta will be held in 2018, 07 in 3 cities, for 7 days, the ticket will cost 39.75$, and has 2 spoken language”).

 The equals() method must first check if the passed object (to compare to) is null and if it is of a different type than the calling object. The method would clearly return false if any of these conditions is true; otherwise the comparison of the attributes are conducted to see if the two objects are actually equal. You need to add a comment indicating how effective these null verifications inside the method will be in relation to protecting your program from crashing!

 For all classes, with the exception of the Festival class, you are required to use the appropriate packages access rights. For the Festival class for example, you are required to use protected access rights.

 When accessing attributes from a base class, you must take full advantage of the permitted rights. For instance, if you can directly access an attribute by name from a base class, then you must do so instead of using a public method from that base class to access the attribute.

3. Write a driver program ( that contains the main() method) that would utilize all of your classes. The driver class can be in a separate package or in any of the already existing four packages. In the main() method you must:

 Create various objects from the 6 classes, and display all their information using the toString() method.

 Test the equality of some to the created objects using the equals() method.

 Create an array of 10 Event objects and fill that array with various objects from the 6 classes (each class must have at least one entry in that array).

 Trace(search) that array to find the object that:

(a) Has the least/most number of cities

(b) Are happening on the same year (e.g. 2018)

For both (a) and (b) display all information of the objects along with their location (index) in the array.

Part II

For the requirements of this part, you need to modify your implementation from Part I as follows:

1. The classes from part I, must now have the most restrictive (secure/protective) access rights to their attributes. Adjust your implementation from Part I accordingly, and comment on the decision about using restricted access (i.e. what are the tradeoffs).

2. In the driver program of this part, you need to add to the one from part I, another static method (add it to the above main()method), called copyFestival(). The method will take as imput an array of Event (an array of any size) and returns an array of Event. That is to say, the method needs to create an array of the same length as the passed paramter one, copy all Festival from the passed array to a new array then return it. Your copy of the objects must use the copy constructors of the different listed classes.

3. In the driver program, create an array of 12 objects (must have at least one from each of the classes), then call the copyFestival() method to create a copy of the that array.

4. Display the contents of both arrays, then add some comments indicating whether or not the coping is correct. If not; you need to explain why it has not been sucessful or as you might expected.
